This post is dedicated to my friend [**Kamil Vacek (Camo)**](https://www.vacekdesign.com) and his talent for making public spaces more pleasant places.

The graffiti is painted on the wall in [**Zemsk√° Street in Teplice**](https://www.google.com/maps/@50.6577723,13.8362357,3a,75y,233.75h,82.15t/data=!3m7!1e1!3m5!1sESP8tkQMhFuP7C-8dOMblg!2e0!6shttps:%2F%2Fstreetviewpixels-pa.googleapis.com%2Fv1%2Fthumbnail%3Fpanoid%3DESP8tkQMhFuP7C-8dOMblg%26cb_client%3Dmaps_sv.tactile.gps%26w%3D203%26h%3D100%26yaw%3D51.351086%26pitch%3D0%26thumbfov%3D100!7i16384!8i8192?hl=cs-CZ&coh=205409&entry=ttu).

The goal of this effort was to obtain a single long shot instead of a classic panoramic photograph that wouldn't be distorted.

The shot was created by taking a [**photograph**](data/working folder) every 5 steps, which were then stitched together in Photoshop.

Inspiration for the future:  
Next time, it would be good to ensure that all photos are taken from the same angle, as the most work was involved in dealing with the fact that each shot was slightly tilted in a different direction, which significantly slowed down the stitching process. Ideally, some sort of stand with a wheel (or wheels) would be used to ensure that all photos are taken from the same distance, height, and angle.
